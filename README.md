# README: Oracle Pluggable Database (PDB) Creation and Management

## Introduction
A Pluggable Database (PDB) is a self-contained, fully functional Oracle database that resides within a Container Database (CDB). PDBs allow for easy provisioning, management, and consolidation of multiple databases. This README covers how to manage PDBs, including creating, altering, and deleting them, along with managing users.

## Connecting to the Database
To connect to the Oracle database as a SYSDBA user, use the following command:

```sql
sqlplus sys/seth123@//localhost:1521/XEPDB1 AS SYSDBA
```

### Explanation:
- **sqlplus**: Command-line tool for accessing Oracle databases.
- **sys**: The default administrative user in Oracle.
- **seth123**: Password for the SYSDBA user.
- **//localhost:1521/XEPDB1**: The connection string specifying the host, port, and service name.

## Check Existing PDBs
To check the list of Pluggable Databases (PDBs) within the Container Database (CDB), use:

```sql
show pdbs;
```

### Output:
```
CON_ID CON_NAME                       OPEN MODE  RESTRICTED
---------- ------------------------------ ---------- ----------
         3 XEPDB1                         READ WRITE NO
```

### Explanation:
- **CON_ID**: Container ID of the PDB.
- **CON_NAME**: Name of the PDB.
- **OPEN MODE**: Indicates whether the PDB is open for read-write or read-only operations.
- **RESTRICTED**: Indicates if the PDB is in restricted mode.

## Create a New Pluggable Database (PDB)
To create a new PDB called `plsql_class2024db`, use the following command:

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE plsql_class2024db
  FROM XEPDB1
  FILE_NAME_CONVERT =
  ('C:\app\Administrator\product\21c\oradata\XE\XEPDB1',
   'C:\app\Administrator\product\21c\oradata\XE\plsql_class2024db');
```

### Output:
```
Pluggable database created.
```

### Explanation:
- **CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE**: Command to create a new PDB.
- **FROM XEPDB1**: Specifies the source PDB from which to create the new PDB.
- **FILE_NAME_CONVERT**: Converts the location of the data files to the new PDB's location.

## Show Current PDB Connection
To see the current PDB connection, use:

```sql
SHOW CON_NAME;
```

### Output:
```
CON_NAME
------------------------------
XEPDB1
```

### Explanation:
- **SHOW CON_NAME**: Displays the name of the currently connected PDB.

## Alter PDB
To open the newly created PDB, use:

```sql
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE plsql_class2024db OPEN;
```

### Output:
```
Pluggable database altered.
```

### Explanation:
- **ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE**: Command to modify the state of a PDB (e.g., open or close it).

## Create a New User in the PDB
Now, let’s create a new user `se_plsqlauca` for database operations:

```sql
CREATE USER se_plsqlauca IDENTIFIED BY seth123;
```

### Output:
```
User created.
```

### Explanation:
- **CREATE USER**: Command to create a new database user.
- **IDENTIFIED BY**: Specifies the password for the user.

## Create a PDB to Be Deleted
To create another PDB named `SE_TO_DELETE_PDB`, use the following command:

```sql
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE SE_TO_DELETE_PDB
  FROM XEPDB1
  FILE_NAME_CONVERT =
  ('C:\app\PC\product\21c\oradata\XE\XEPDB1',
   'C:\app\PC\product\21c\oradata\XE\SE_TO_DELETE_PDB');
```

### Output:
```
Pluggable database created.
```

### Explanation:
- This command creates a new PDB named `SE_TO_DELETE_PDB` using the existing PDB `XEPDB1` as a template.

## Conclusion
This README provides an overview of the key concepts and SQL commands involved in managing Oracle Pluggable Databases (PDBs). You have learned how to connect to the database, create and manage PDBs, and create users. You are now equipped with the fundamental operations necessary for PDB management in Oracle.
